# Machine Learning Interpretability

<br>



<br>

PyTorch is an open-source machine learning framework based on the Torch library, that allows you to build and deploy neural network models easily. It is used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing, primarily developed by Facebook's AI Research (FAIR) lab. It is well-supported on major cloud platforms, providing frictionless development and easy scaling. Its Pythonic nature and the latest mobile model support have propelled PyTorch to such popularity, with its usage extending from research to industry. Today, leading companies like Tesla, Lyft, Disney, Microsoft, Airbnb, Toyota, Facebook (of course), etc. are using PyTorch frequently to help scale their deep learning models from research to deployment.
